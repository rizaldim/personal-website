Hi, there! I am Rizaldi. I work as DevOps Engineer in one of tech companies in
Indonesia. I started my career as Android Engineer in 2015 and since 2018 I switched
full time to work in DevOps/Infra/SRE role. I know that those three roles are actually
different but in Indonesian job market often times the job recruiters almost always
treat it as the same. This website is my own personal website and any opinions
here doesn't reflect of my employers'. This website is for my own personal notes,
learnings, and opinions.

I am always open to a new role so if, after reading my website, you think that
I am a good fit for a job opportunity or position in your team please contact me.
I am reachable through my email, zal[at]fastmail.com.
